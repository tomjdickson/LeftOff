# LeftOff - "Pick up from where you left off"

## Introduction
I am constantly saving things that I intend to read later but never really get around to reading, so I thought I would creating a Chrome Extension to mitigate this.

## How it works
Periods

When you add a bookmark into the automatically generated "Read Later" bookmark folders (sometimes refered to as groups [source](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/bookmarks)) LeftOff will be automatically notified, at the end of the chosen period you will be notified what you have left to read.

When you later navigate to that site and close it off LeftOff will query you to see if you are still reading, you can mark this as yes or no...
